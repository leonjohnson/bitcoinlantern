# BitcoinLantern

A small Bitcoin library that's delightfully easy to read and easy to use.

Key Features:
- Create a wallet to manage your keys
- Generate keys and addresses (P2PKH, P2SH, Bech32, xpub)
- Generate mnemonics
- Great documentation

Todo:
- RPC: query a full Bitcoin node
- Create and sign a Bitcoin transaction
- Create a Lightning invoice
- Decode a Lightning invoice
- Open a LN channel
- Create and sign a Lightning transaction

With Bitcoin Lantern you can do things such as

```
from bitcoinlantern.bitcoin.wallet import Wallet, Mnemonic, Address

w = Wallet()


address = w.createBech32() # by default the public key is compressed and the address is for mainnet


address.string()
'bc1qh5j2qju2g2rpcvea4yjmdzvgqlmhjdg4sw9k9a'


address.private_key()
'Kwz5z5cqLkr46PZeJQuZhTeNbRQ7LMpBmkQ9dgKfBNedJh14ZLMv'


address.mnemonic	
'mad gun cart mix random nasty suffer snake change beyond liberty maid monster tip ritual alone among hurdle fresh trap curious fan monster decrease'


address.type
'Bech32'
